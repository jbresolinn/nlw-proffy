## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; What is Proffy?

Proffy is an open source project that aims to connect teacher and students to private classes. 

It was developed during the second edition of Next Level Week at Rocketseat, from August 3 to 9, 2020.

You can learn more about Rocketseat and Next Level Week [here](https://rocketseat.com.br/) and [here](http://nextlevelweek.com/).

## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; What technologies are used?

For the development of Proffy, the stack was used as a basis: `node.js`, `reactjs` and `react native`.

Along with the stack, technologies such as restfull api, hooks, sqlite storage, mobile first and reponsiveness, among others, were used.
